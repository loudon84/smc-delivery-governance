# GES 6 Composer Bootstrap

GES 6 is a Composer plus Governance Backplane. Alpha.1 only ships the Composer bootstrap that composes Matt, Spec Kit and Superpowers into a business repo.

Alpha.1 Functionally Complete: official Spec Kit staging, Cursor runtime, and Golden Consumer are PASS. Tag remains PENDING RELEASE HARDENING until an immutable candidate SHA has external evidence.

Alpha.2 synthetic backplane acceptances exist. Live Golden merge observation was skipped by operator and is not a READY claim. See [[governance-backplane]].

v5 execution-centric runtime in `engineeing-skills/` is frozen and is not part of v6 core. See [[ADR-012-ges6-composer-backplane-boundary]], [[composer]], [[governance-backplane]] and [[ges]].

Operator CLI and consumer `ges init` commands for the current 6.x release live in repo-root `GUIDE.md`.
